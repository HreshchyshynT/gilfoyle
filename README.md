```

## Why the name Gilfoyle? 

The idea was inspired by a dialogue in the series Silicon Valley. In a conversation, Gilfoyle said 
> People don't uninstall apps from their phone

I think he's right, and I thought why don't we create a tool for that ðŸ¤·

## Test

Before executing the test

- One device must be connected via adb
- `config.json` should have valid adb path
